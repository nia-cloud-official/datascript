### Basic Features and Syntax Example

1. **Loading Data**

   ```plaintext
   LOAD "data.csv" INTO dataset;
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Loads data from a CSV file named `data.csv` into a variable named `dataset`.

2. **Summarizing Data**

   ```plaintext
   SUMMARIZE dataset;
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Provides a summary (statistics) of the dataset stored in the `dataset` variable.

3. **Filtering Data**

   ```plaintext
   FILTER dataset WHERE age > 30 INTO filtered_data;
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Filters records in `dataset` where the `age` column is greater than 30 and stores the filtered result in `filtered_data`.

4. **Grouping Data**

   ```plaintext
   GROUP dataset BY category INTO grouped_data;
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Groups data in `dataset` by the `category` column and stores the grouped result in `grouped_data`.

5. **Custom Functions**

   ```plaintext
   DEFINE FUNCTION mean(list) {
       SUM = 0;
       COUNT = 0;
       FOR EACH value IN list {
           SUM = SUM + value;
           COUNT = COUNT + 1;
       }
       RETURN SUM / COUNT;
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Defines a custom function `mean` to calculate the mean of a list of numbers.

6. **Plotting Data**

   ```plaintext
   PLOT histogram OF dataset BINS 10;
   ```

   - **Explanation**: Generates a histogram plot of the `dataset` variable with 10 bins.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Syntax**: Keep the syntax simple and intuitive, resembling natural language where possible.
- **Data Types**: Support a variety of data types such as integers, floats, strings, dates, lists, and dictionaries.
- **Operations**: Provide built-in functions and operators for common data operations like arithmetic, comparisons, and string manipulations.
- **Customization**: Allow users to define custom functions and handle complex data manipulations.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
LOAD "data.csv" INTO dataset;
SUMMARIZE dataset;
FILTER dataset WHERE age > 30 INTO older_people;
GROUP dataset BY category INTO categories;
DEFINE FUNCTION mean(list) {
    SUM = 0;
    COUNT = 0;
    FOR EACH value IN list {
        SUM = SUM + value;
        COUNT = COUNT + 1;
    }
    RETURN SUM / COUNT;
}
PLOT histogram OF dataset BINS 10;
```

### Notes

- This example provides a basic framework for a data scripting language focused on ease of use and effectiveness.
- Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to expand upon these features, handle more complex data structures, and integrate with external libraries or APIs for advanced functionality.
- Designing such a language involves balancing simplicity with versatility, ensuring that users can perform powerful data manipulations without unnecessary complexity.
